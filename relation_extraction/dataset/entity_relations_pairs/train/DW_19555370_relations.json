The musicians announced that they would be ending it all in 2010, following a three-year tour. But things didn’t turn out that way! The two-part documentary Forever and a Day – The Scorpions Film tells the story of a band that just can’t stop living the dream. Director Katja von Garnier accompanied the five artists on their tour of the globe: the key locations in the film are Bangkok, Beirut, Berlin, Budapest, Moscow, Paris and L.A. At the same time, the documentary charts the history of the group, with archive footage of the most thrilling moments of the past five decades.
