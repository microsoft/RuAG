  "content": "Sicily: The pontiff of Palermo\nFor Biagio Conte they're all brothers: the refugees stranded in Sicily. While Europe turns a cold shoulder, the self-proclaimed monk welcomes them with warmth.\nHe has been waging a successful campaign of compassion. First he had just a room in Palermo's railway station at his disposal. Later a disused monastery was added. And finally, after months of protests, he managed to get Palermo to give him an old barracks in the city center. He takes care of 700 refugees, providing them with shelter, food and sometimes education. And in the end, some of them find real prospects for the future.",
