  "content": "How to recycle plastic yourself\nEvery year, we humans produce over 310 million tons of plastic. Unfortunately, just a fraction of it gets recycled. Now a designer from Holland has come up with a way for anyone to turn plastic waste into new products.\n#doingyourbit is a campaign that invites anyone working on protecting the environment - whether through conservation, innovation or mitigation - to submit their projects and stories to us to be profiled both on eco@africa TV and online. The idea is to receive user generated content or produce our own content to showcase existing activities of people in Africa and Europe and to inspire others to embark on new environmental initiatives that could help to save our planet.",
