  "content": "Coming Home - India\nWe’re hardly aware of it until it’s gone, and then we know what we’ve lost – or haven’t lost as the case may be: home. What do people feel when they return to a country they left, trading it for a life in Germany?\nHarmeet Bans Success demanded a few sacrifices: Once in Germany, Harmeet \"Bunty\" Bans shaved off his beard, cut his hair and gave up his turban. And today, he’s the proud owner of a chain of restaurants in Berlin. But he’s never lost contact with his relatives or religious roots. This feature report follows Bunty through a land of contrasts, from the city of his birth, Bombay, now Mumbai, to Amritsar, home of the Golden Temple, the most sacred shrine of the Sikhs. From Punjab we continue to Goa, and everywhere Bunty goes, he meets friends and relatives.

He and his family now have German passports. He takes us to the scenes of his childhood and teenage years from Chennai to Kolkata, once known to the West as Calcutta. Anand shows us a country that has undergone radical changes in the past few decades - just as he has himself: an ethnic Tamil and IT specialist, he’s found a new home in Munich, where he now lives in a duplex with his wife and two children.
