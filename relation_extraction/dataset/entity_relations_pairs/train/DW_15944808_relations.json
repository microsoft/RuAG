Constanceis great for history buffs. It’s the largest town on the lake of the same name, and is famous for hosting the 15th-century church council that ended the Papal Schism. The actual site where the new pope was elected can still be seen. Then there are the Romanesque churches on Reichenau Island, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Nature lovers will also enjoy the island of Mainau, whose parks and gardens boast over a million flowers in the summer. It’s also the site of a palace still is use as a residence. Those who want a bit more action can go cycling or sailing. The town of Wasserburg has a rather special boat to rent: the steamship Felicitas.
