  "content": "Climate lab - a lake within a lake\nThe lake laboratory - or LakeLab - at the Stechlinsee is said to be the only one of its kind in the world.\nLocated some 91 kilometers north of Berlin, itâ€™s composed of a series of large tubes made of synthetic material reaching down into the lake bed. At about nine meters in diameter, the cylinders are like enormous test tubes. They have developed a lamp which uses no mercury, but rather less toxic metal compounds - the exact combination of which is a well-kept secret. Microwaves activate the substances inside the lamp which then emit light. Electrodes and filaments are likely to be a thing of the past if the lamp is as marketable as its inventers hope!",
