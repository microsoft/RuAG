In the video, a Le Petit Journal reporter asks the child if he understood why the attacks occurred. \"Do you understand what happened? Do you understand why those people did that?\" the reporter asked. \"Yes, because they're really, really mean. Bad guys are not very nice,\" the child responds to the reporter. However, the child's father later intervenes, responding to his son's statement that they could be shot, saying: \"They might have guns, but we have flowers.\" The father then offers an overview of how flowers and candles \"protect\" people from guns. \"The flowers and the candles are here to protect us,\" the child said, confirming his father's statement.
