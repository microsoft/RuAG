Sitting in front of the fire with a purring cat upon your lap, having a loyal dog guarding the house and family, or watching a goldfish swim around its bowl for hours on end. Having a Hausdrache (lit: house dragon) in the household is quite a different matter! A Drache is a mythical beast which spits fire, battles knights in shining armour, and steals beautiful princesses. A Hausdrache is equally unpleasant and describes a domineering housewife. \"Take your shoes off, I just cleaned the floor,\" \"donâ€™t talk with your mouth full,\" \"go and tidy your room,\" she shouts angrily. But perhaps inside every Hausdrache there is a beautiful princess just waiting to be rescued from cleaning and cooking?",
