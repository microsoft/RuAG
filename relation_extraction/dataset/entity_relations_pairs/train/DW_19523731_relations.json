  "content": "Beginner: veteran German rappers are back\nThe hip-hop trio Beginner from Hamburg made their fans wait 13 years for a new album. The delay may have been Jan Delay, as he pursued a solo career. Now, Beginner have moved on to \"Advanced Chemistry\".\nAfter 25 years in the business, Beginner are anything but. The German rappers have built and held onto a cult following. Now, after pursuing solo ventures, they're back together. But the music scene has changed radically since their last album 13 years ago.",
