Clarence House — the residence of Prince Harry's father Prince Charles — released a statement on Monday announcing the engagement. \"His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales is delighted to announce the engagement of Prince Harry to Ms. Meghan Markle,\" the statement read. It said the couple had become engaged earlier this month. The wedding will take place next spring, and the couple are to live in Nottingham Cottage in Kensington Palace. Prince Harry tweeted thanks to those who wished the couple well: Speculation had been rife that 33-year-old Harry would propose to the 36-year-old divorcee Markle, who is best known for her role in the legal drama series \"Suits.\" The couple have been together since June 2016. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, Harry's older brother Prince William and Kate Middleton, congratulated the couple. \"We are very excited for Harry and Meghan. It has been wonderful getting to know Meghan and to see how happy she and Harry are together,\" Clarence House said in a tweet.
