  "content": "Australian stock exchange boss steps down\nThe head of Australia's stock exchange resigned Monday amid allegations of bribery at a gambling group he previously ran. Elmer Funke Kupper had been CEO of the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) since October 2011.\nFunke Kupper has also taken a leave of absence from the board of Tabcorp, Australia's largest bookmaker, which is currently being investigated by the Australian Federal Police. The allegations center on a payment of $151,460 (134,535 euros) to the bookmaker by relatives of Cambodia's Prime Minister Hen Sen. Tabcorp, a publicly listed company, had reportedly been looking to expand into the country. Funke Kupper told the media last week that he had no recollection of such a payment during his four years at the helm of Tabcorp, which said it did not pursue the expansion opportunity in Cambodia. ASX chairman Rick Holliday-Smith said the board \"accepted that Elmer wanted to direct his full focus to the investigations which may be made into the Tabcorp matter - and not have them interfere with the important role of leading the ASX\". A statement by the ASX announced that Rick Holliday-Smith will take over Funke Kupper's duties until a replacement is found. AFP, ASX (hch/bea)",
