This time, we meet with Tonatiuh Ibarra from Mexico. He's a university student majoring in German Studies, so he decided to come to Europe for three months for a German language course at the Goethe Institute in Freiburg. A good choice: Freiburg is a charming university town in southwestern Germany attracting three million visitors a year! Let’s find out how Tonatiuh spent his day with our camera crew.",
